# RelocBonus

This is the repository for the tool from my [Relocation Bonus](https://github.com/nickcano/RelocBonusSlides) talk at DEFCON 26.

Even though there are no 0days in this tool, we've agreed that we should allow time for people to become familiar with the attack and, if they're proactive enough, fix their software to deal with it. For this reason, we've mapped out the following timeline:

- **Aug 11, 2018** - Initial disclosure; DEFCON talk and release of slides
- **Aug 27, 2018** - Release of samples packed with the tool
- **Sept 3, 2018** - Release of tool and all source code to public

Upon the final milestone in this timeline, this repo will house the source code for the tool.
